CONTEXT:
- Target stake room: ${context.targetStake} coins
- Previous screen state: ${context.previousState || 'unknown'}

SCREEN DETECTION - Identify which screen this is:
- "home": Main menu with "Online Multiplayer", "Play vs Friends", "Play with AI" buttons
- "multiplayer_menu": Sub-menu with 3 play mode banners
- "lobby": Room list showing stake rooms (Millionaire's Club 25000, Big Cake 10000, New Takers 5000, 2K Wahala 2000, Face to Face 1000)
- "join_confirm": Dialog "Join Lobby? Are you sure you want to join this room for" with NO/YES,CONTINUE buttons
- "waiting": Whoto Whoto logo, "Waiting for other players..." with timer and Leave Lobby button
- "game_confirm": Dialog "Continue? Are you sure you want to proceed with the game?" with NO/YES,CONTINUE buttons
- "starting": "Starting Game" text with timer at 00:00
- "game_playing": Game board with oval green table, cards in hand at bottom, discard pile center
- "suit_selection": Popup asking to choose a suit (circle/triangle/cross/square/star)
- "game_over": Game results screen
- "login": Login/signup screen
- "unknown": Cannot determine

GAME ANALYSIS (only if screen is "game_playing"):
1. Read ALL cards in your hand (bottom of screen). Each card has a SHAPE (circle=●, triangle=▲, cross=✚, square=■, star=★) and a NUMBER.
2. Read the TOP CARD on the discard pile (center of the green table).
3. Check if it's your turn (green bar at top saying "Your Turn").
4. Count opponent's cards (shown next to their avatar).
5. Read market/draw pile count (shown below the face-down pile).

CARD MATCHING RULES:
- You can play a card if it matches the TOP CARD's SUIT or NUMBER
- WHOT (20) can be played on anything — you then choose a suit

SPECIAL CARDS (by number):
- 1 = Hold On → Skip the next player's turn. In 2-player game, YOU play again.
- 2 = Pick Two → Next player must draw 2 cards. BUT they can "plus" it by playing their own 2 on top — penalty passes on and accumulates (+2 each chain: 2→4→6→8 etc). If you can't plus it, you draw the full penalty.
- 8 = Suspension → Next player is SUSPENDED. YOU get to play again immediately.
- 14 = General Market → EVERY opponent draws 1 card from the market. YOU play again immediately.
- 20 = Whot (Wild) → Can be played on ANY card regardless of suit or number. You declare which suit the next player must follow.

WINNING CONDITIONS — TWO WAYS TO WIN:
1. CHECK UP: Play your last card and you win immediately. ANY card can be your winning card — including Pick Two(2), Whot(20), or any special. The moment your hand is empty, you WIN.
2. MARKET EXHAUSTED: When the draw pile runs out, all players count the face values of their remaining cards. Star(★) cards count DOUBLE their face value. The player with the LOWEST total score wins.

CRITICAL STRATEGY RULES:
- Your #1 goal is to EMPTY YOUR HAND as fast as possible (check up)
- If you have 1 card left and can play it — ALWAYS PLAY IT. That's an instant win.
- Suspension(8) and General Market(14) give you EXTRA TURNS — these are your most powerful cards. Play them to chain multiple plays in a row.
- Pick Two(2) is both offensive AND defensive: use it to punish opponents, plus opponent's Pick Twos, or as your last card to check up.
- When opponent has ≤2 cards they're close to winning — BLOCK THEM with Pick Two(2), Hold On(1), or Suspension(8).
- Hold On(1) in a 2-player game = you play again (same effect as Suspension).
- Save WHOT(20) for when you're stuck (no matching cards) or as a finisher when close to winning.
- Play cards of suits you have MANY of — this maintains your options for future turns.
- Get rid of HIGH VALUE cards early, especially Star(★) cards which count DOUBLE if the market runs out.
- When down to 2 cards, the app auto-announces "semi last card".
- When down to 1 card, the app auto-announces "last card".

PRIORITY ORDER for card selection:
1. If it's your LAST card and it's playable → PLAY IT (instant win / check up)
2. If opponent has 1-2 cards → play blocking cards (Pick Two, Hold On, Suspension)
3. Suspension(8) or General Market(14) → extra turn is always valuable
4. High-value Star(★) cards → get rid of them early (they count double)
5. Cards from your dominant suit → maintains future options
6. Pick Two(2) → save for defense/offense unless needed now
7. WHOT(20) → save for when stuck or close to winning
